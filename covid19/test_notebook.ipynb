Patients admitted to the ICU, <b>aged</b> > = 18 <b>years</b>, <b>mechanically</b> <b>ventilated</b> for > = 48 hours and with the final diagnosis of ICU-acquired weakness were selected. Predictive factors of ICU-AW were identified using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: From the <b>177 patients</b> included, 20,3% developed ICU-AW. The mean <b>age</b> was 57,3 <b>years</b> and 58,3% were female. The median time of <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> was 343,5 hours. 55,6% of patients had solid tumors and 44,4% had hematological malignancies. Glucocorticoids and neuromuscular blocking <b>agents</b> were administered in 88,9% and 38,9% of patients, respectively. Septic shock developed in 72,2% of patients and was found to be a predictive factor for developing ICU-AW (OR 4,15, pvalue 0,018). 66,7% of patients started or continued physical rehabilitation during the hospital length of stay approximately 12 <b>days</b> after admission in the ICU. 44,4% of patients with ICU-AW <b>died</b> 37 <b>days</b> after admission in the ICU. <b>8 patients</b> (22,2%) with ICU-AW were re-evaluated by physical and rehabilitation medicine 144 <b>days</b> after hospital <b>discharge</b>. Significant improvement was noted in their physical status while in the program of physical therapy. Conclusions: ICU-AW is a relatively frequent problem and septic shock was found to be a predictive factor for the development of this entity. Early mobilization is an important intervention to decrease the weakness and physical deconditioning in the critically ill patients. P412   "

Eighty-three patients ≥18 <b>years</b> were included in the study. All patients were dependent on <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> and met the CCM criteria for sepsis upon admission to the ICU. APACHE II score, SOFA score, weight, BMI and nutritional status were calculated. Patients were initiated for enteral feeding based on the established feeding protocol within 48 hours of admission. The feeding status of the patient was recorded on the start <b>day</b> (D0), <b>day</b> 3 (D3) and <b>day</b> 7 (D7). Factors aff ecting the feeding process and its progression were also recorded Results The patient mean <b>age</b> was 71.4 ± 12.2. LOS in the ICU was 9 to 21 <b>days</b>. Based on BMI, 18% of the patients were malnourished upon admission. APACHE II was 26 ± 7.8 and SOFA was 9.2 ± 4.6. The <b>mortality</b> rate was 42.5%. Enteral nutrition started early in 64 (77.1%) of the patients (D0), on <b>day</b> 3 (D3) 29 (45.31%) patients met their caloric goals and on <b>day</b> 7 (D7) only 18 (28.1%) patients achieved their caloric goals. Discontinuation of enteral feeding was mainly due to procedures, whereas late start and/or decreased hourly intake were due to GI complications, GI intolerance, excessive diarrhoea and hemodynamic instability. There was no association between compliance with the feeding protocol and the LOS, nutritional status, severity or disease progression. P423   "
