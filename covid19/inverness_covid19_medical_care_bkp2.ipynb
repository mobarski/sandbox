       "142 :: 0.289 :: 297634<br>Infections are a frequent <span style=\"background-color:#FFAAAA\">complication</span> after stroke. Pneumonia is the most frequent site of infection and is associated with lower <span style=\"background-color:#00FF00\">survival</span> and impaired neurologic <span style=\"background-color:#00FFFF\">outcome</span>. Studies focusing on intensive care <span style=\"\">patients</span> show the highest incidence of pneumonia, but are very heterogeneous in the severity of selected <span style=\"\">patients</span>. To date, there is no study focusing exclusively on the epidemiology and prognostic impact of pneumonia in <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">mechanically</span> <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">ventilated</span> stroke <span style=\"\">patients</span>. Furthermore, previous studies lack the <span style=\"background-color:#FFFF00\">adjustment</span> for early decisions to forgo life-sustaining treatment (DFLST) which is a significant confounder in these <span style=\"\">patients</span>. <span style=\"\">Patients</span> and methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of a large prospective multicenter database over a 20-year period (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) (2016) . We included all adult ischemic stroke <span style=\"\">patients</span> admitted to the ICU who required invasive <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">mechanical</span> <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">ventilation</span> at ICU admission. The relation between the <span style=\"background-color:#00FFFF\">occurrence</span> of pneumonia during ICU <span style=\"\">stay</span> and 30-<span style=\"\">day</span> <span style=\"background-color:#FFAAAA\">mortality</span> was investigated using a Cox proportional hazard model, <span style=\"background-color:#FFFF00\">adjusted</span> on DFLST. Data are presented as <span style=\"background-color:#00FFFF\">median</span> (interquartile range) or numbers (percentages). <span style=\"background-color:#00FFFF\">Results</span>: We identified 195 <span style=\"\">patients</span> (<span style=\"background-color:#FFFF00\">age</span> 69 (61-76) <span style=\"background-color:#FFFF00\">years</span>, male gender 132 (67.7%) <span style=\"\">patients</span>) from 11 ICUs. On ICU admission, the <span style=\"background-color:#FFCC00\">Glasgow coma</span> scale score (<span style=\"background-color:#FFCC00\">GCS</span>) was 6 (3-, 0) and the Simplified Acute Physiology score 2 (<span style=\"background-color:#FFCC00\">SAPS</span> 2) score was 56 (45-66). <span style=\"\">Patients</span> required vasopressors in 92 (47.2%) cases and renal replacement therapy in 17 (8.7%) cases. DFLST <span style=\"background-color:#00FFFF\">occurred</span> 5 (2-8) <span style=\"\">days</span> after ICU admission in 65 (33.3%) <span style=\"\">patients</span>. Withholding of care and withdrawal of care were observed in 31 (15.9%) and 34 (17.4%) cases, respectively. <span style=\"background-color:#00FF00\">Survival</span> at <span style=\"\">day</span> 3six, 6 months and one year was 44%, 32, 6% and 29.7% respectively. During ICU <span style=\"\">stay</span>, there were 90 pneumonia episodes, <span style=\"background-color:#00FFFF\">occurring</span> at least once in 74 (37.9%) <span style=\"\">patients</span>. Pneumonia caused sepsis and septic shock (SEPSIS-3 definition) in 40 (44.4%) and 33 (36.7%) cases respectively. After <span style=\"background-color:#FFFF00\">adjustment</span>, the <span style=\"background-color:#00FFFF\">occurrence</span> of pneumonia during ICU <span style=\"\">stay</span> was not associated with 30-<span style=\"\">day</span> <span style=\"background-color:#FFAAAA\">mortality</span> (<span style=\"background-color:#FFAAFF\">figure</span> 1). Conclusion: In this <span style=\"background-color:#00FFFF\">cohort</span> of <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">mechanically</span> <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">ventilated</span> <span style=\"\">patients</span> with acute ischemic stroke, pneumonia was a frequent <span style=\"background-color:#FFAAAA\">complication</span> but was not associated with 30-<span style=\"\">day</span> <span style=\"background-color:#FFAAAA\">mortality</span>. Impact of pneumonia on functional <span style=\"background-color:#00FFFF\">outcomes</span> in <span style=\"background-color:#00FF00\">survivors</span> should be investigated in further studies.

The aim of the study is to assess the frequency of <span style=\"\">patients</span> admitted for hypercapnic respiratory failure without prior pulmonary diagnosis, and assign a final diagnosis with emphasis on morbid overlaps. <span style=\"\">Patients</span> and methods: In consecutive <span style=\"\">patients</span> admitted in the ICU for hypercapnic respiratory failure demographic and clinical data pertaining to current and prior hospitalisations were recorded. <span style=\"\">Patients</span> were managed for the acute episode, and when they were considered for ICU <span style=\"background-color:#00FF00\">discharge</span>, the following was performed-pulmonary CT scan with particular emphasis on emphysema and fibrosis patterns, spirometry for the diagnosis of obstructive lung disease, transthoracic cardiac echography, and nocturnal polygraphy for the diagnosis of sleep apnea syndrome (AHI ≥ 5). <span style=\"background-color:#00FFFF\">Results</span>: During the study period, 107 <span style=\"\">patients</span> (mean <span style=\"background-color:#FFFF00\">age</span> 66 ± 6 <span style=\"background-color:#FFFF00\">years</span>, 63% male) were consecutively admitted for severe hypercapnic respiratory failure requiring <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">ventilatory</span> support. NIV was started in 83% <span style=\"\">patients</span> with a failure rate 20%. <span style=\"background-color:#FFAAFF\">Table</span> 1 reports the pulmonary diseases eventually adjudicated at admission, and at ICU <span style=\"background-color:#00FF00\">discharge</span>. Conclusion: Reliable information on actual lung diseases of <span style=\"\">patients</span> admitted for hypercapnic respiratory failure is often lacking at ICU admission. Our study highlights the frequency of COPD, bronchiectasis, and obesity-hypo<span style=\"font-weight:bold\">ventilation</span> syndrome in these <span style=\"\">patients</span>. Overlaps are frequently present in these <span style=\"\">patients</span> with a need for characterization of their evolutionary genius in the short and long term. Introduction: Despite the wide spread use of home <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">mechanical</span> <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">ventilation</span> (HMV) to treat chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure, compliance with HMV among <span style=\"\">patients</span> has seldom been systematically studied. Evaluating <span style=\"background-color:#00FFFF\">outcomes</span> for ICU <span style=\"background-color:#00FF00\">survivors</span> requiring home <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">mechanical</span> <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">ventilation</span> is also interesting. The aim was to determine <span style=\"\">patients</span>' compliance to home <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">mechanical</span> <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">ventilation</span> indicated at <span style=\"background-color:#00FF00\">discharge</span> and to determine <span style=\"\">patients</span>' <span style=\"background-color:#00FFFF\">outcomes</span> and quality of life within three months after <span style=\"background-color:#00FF00\">discharge</span>. <span style=\"\">Patients</span> and methods: It is a retros pective observational study conducted in a 9-bed medical ICU. All consecutive <span style=\"\">patients</span> <span style=\"background-color:#00FF00\">discharged</span> from ICU with home <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">mechanical</span> <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">ventilation</span> between January, 1st 2015 and of December, 31st 2017 were included. Data collected involved <span style=\"\">patients</span>' demographics, past history and underlying diseases, functional state, clinical, paraclinical, therapeutic and ICU <span style=\"\">stay</span> course characteristics. At <span style=\"background-color:#00FF00\">discharge</span>, data on types, modes and indications of home <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">mechanical</span> <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">ventilation</span>, were gathered. Compliance reports were obtained from providers after one to three months of use. Vital status and quality of life as assessed by the St. Georges Hospital on Respiratory Problems (SGRQ), were estimated via phone calls at three months after <span style=\"background-color:#00FF00\">discharge</span>. <span style=\"background-color:#00FFFF\">Results</span>: Among a to tal of 717 ICU admitted <span style=\"\">patients</span>, 635 required <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">mechanical</span> <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">ventilation</span>. 66(10.4%) <span style=\"\">patients</span> were <span style=\"background-color:#00FF00\">discharged</span> with HMV, 38(57.6%) via non-invasive <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">ventilation</span> and 28(42.4%) on tracheostomy (TPPV).

       "126 :: 0.332 :: 860451<br>Introduction Contrary to wards that manage usually chronic or acute pain (algology, gerontology, surgery, recovery room, and so forth), a comparison of the fi ve most popular self-report pain tools (vertical and horizontal Visual Analog Scale (VAS-V, VAS-H), 0 to 10 oral Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-O), 0 to 10 visual enlarged NRS (NRS-V), Verbal Descriptor Scale (VDS)) has never been evaluated in an ICU setting. Methods Consecutive <span style=\"\">patients</span> admitted to a medical-surgical ICU during 1 year were included when alert (RASS >-2) and able to follow simple commands. Exclusion criteria: previous self-report pain assessment without the presence of an investigator. Pain assessment using the fi ve scales in random order either at baseline (T1) and after (T2) administration of an analgesic, or during a nociceptive procedure, in absence of pain at baseline. Evaluated parameters: psychometric properties of scales (feasibility, validity, responsiveness and preference). Nonparametric tests were used for statistical analysis (Statview 5.0). Data are expressed as <span style=\"background-color:#00FFFF\">median</span> (25th to 75th). <span style=\"background-color:#00FFFF\">Results</span> All basal levels were below the expected values. Following enteral administration, pharmacological levels were already reached in 5 minutes, with a serum peak after 16 minutes (half-absorption <span style=\"\">time</span>: 3 minutes 17 seconds). The maximum serum level observed was 11,040 pg/ml and the disappearance rate indicated a half-elimination <span style=\"\">time</span> of 1 hour 34 minutes. Serum melatonin levels decreased signifi cantly after midnight; pharmacological levels were maintained up to 10 hours following administration. No excessive sleepiness was reported in this patient group. Conclusions Critically ill <span style=\"\">patients</span> exhibited reduced melatonin secretion, as reported in the literature. Despite the critical illness, the oral bioavailability was satisfactory: serum levels after oral administration showed basically unchanged intestinal absorption, while the disappearance rate was slower than reported elsewhere in healthy volunteers. Introduction The aim of our study is to describe clinical progress, need for <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">mechanical</span> <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">ventilation</span> (MV), <span style=\"background-color:#FFAAAA\">complications</span> and <span style=\"background-color:#FFAAAA\">mortality</span> of <span style=\"\">patients</span> with delirium tremens (DT) admitted to our ICU. Methods <span style=\"\">Patients</span> with a diagnosis of DT admitted to a medical ICU of a tertiary hospital from January 2001 to December 2008 were included.

Reasons for hospital admission: DT (68%), seizures (36%), sepsis (16%), brain injury (10%). Reasons for admission to the ICU: DT (54%), DT and seizures (26%), DT and brain injury (10%), DT and sepsis (8%), DT and other (2%). <span style=\"background-color:#00FFFF\">Median</span> <span style=\"background-color:#FFCC00\">APACHE</span> II score was 9 (range: 8 to 13). Seventy-four percent of the <span style=\"\">patients</span> were controlled with no need for MV with a midazolam infusion of 45 to 50 μg/kg/hour and haloperidol of 17 to 30 μg/kg/hour. Twenty-eight per cent (14 <span style=\"\">patients</span>) required MV, of them 78% had DT and other associated pathology on admission (<span style=\"background-color:#FFAAFF\">Figure</span> 1 ). From a total of 28 <span style=\"\">patients</span> admitted with DT and no associated pathology, only four needed MV. The <span style=\"background-color:#00FFFF\">median</span> <span style=\"\">time</span> on MV was 2 <span style=\"\">days</span> (range: 1 to 9). <span style=\"background-color:#FFAAAA\">Complications</span> were present in 22%: <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">ventilation</span>-associated pneumonia, and other infectious conditions.

       "124 :: 0.266 :: 1107849<br>Introduction <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Ventilator</span>-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a frequently <span style=\"background-color:#00FFFF\">occurring</span> nosocomial infection in ICU <span style=\"\">patients</span> and has been associated with increased morbidity, prolonged <span style=\"\">duration</span> of <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">ventilation</span> and ICU <span style=\"\">stay</span> and increased costs for healthcare. It was shown that early diagnosis of VAP and immediate initiation of appropriate antibiotics is associated with reduced morbidity and <span style=\"background-color:#FFAAAA\">mortality</span>. The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential ability of a screening test based on the clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS) to identify and treat <span style=\"\">patients</span> with VAP.
