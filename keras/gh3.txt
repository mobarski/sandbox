# Into the Terrorvortex of Kor-Virliath

Between the cosmic wake of a thousand solar nightmares
Chaos will reign eternal



# The Siege of Dunkeld (In Hoots We Trust)

[Intro]
Regis Dundoniensis
Furor Apocalyptus
Magus Calamitosus
Bellis Intergalactus
Regis Dundoniensis
Furor Apocalyptus
Magus Calamitosus
Bellis Intergalactus
Ancient cosmic wormhole
Chaos lord arise

[Verse 1]
I have returned from the future
Into a terrible past
Chaos and war on the plains of Dunkeld
The armies of darkness amassed
Is this a twisted dimension?
Is this true reality?
A symbol of evil is flying once more
Above the proud spires of Dundee
A burning black sun
The siege of Dunkeld has begun
Defeat of the ancient town is nigh
In Hoots we trust

[Verse 2]
Horrifying fecal demons
Rising up out of the caverns below
Dark robotic astral zombies
Eating the peasants who live in Glasgow
Siege engines of hell's creation
Blasting the walls with unholy fire
Undead forces marching onward
Army of evil so tragic and dire

[Pre-Chorus]
Look up to the sky
A glorious battle cry
The forces of justice call his name

[Chorus]
In Hoots we trust
(We Trust)
By the power of the holy king of Unst
(Hail Hoots)
For the glory of Dundee
To win this epic battle
In his power we must trust to set us free
(Confutatis Maledictis Caledoniae)
In Hoots we trust

[Spoken]
I am the Bane of Cowdenbeath
The Scourge of Auchtermuchty
Arch-Foe of the Questlords of Inverness
Come face me in battle, Angus
And prepare to meet thy doom

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
Your dark dominion has corrupted Dundee
With a swing of my hammer I'll end this misery
Legendary battle
Epic war is fight
What mystic enchantment has Zargothrax spun?
My weapon has no effect, this fight can't be won

[Spoken]
Pathetic mortal scum
In this dimension, your hammer has no power over me
Now, kneel before your Emperor
Kneel before your god

[Chorus]
In Hoots we trust
(We Trust)
By the power of the holy king of Unst
(Hail Hoots)
For the glory of Dundee
To win this epic battle
In his power we must trust to set us free
In Hoots we trust
(We Trust)
By the power of the holy king of Unst
(Hail Hoots)
For the glory of Dundee
To win this epic battle
In his power we must trust to set us free
In Hoots we trust



# Masters of the Galaxy

[Verse 1]
Far to the east, an army of evil is rising
(Deathknights of Crail)
Under the spell of sorcerer's twisted design
(To darkness we hail)
With their blades of black fire they enslave the land
Obeying their master’s will
The force of their terror no mortal can stand
(Knights of evil, kill)

[Pre-Chorus]
Long ago in the distant future, they were a force for the light
But now in the ancient times, they slaughter peasants by night

[Chorus]
We are the masters of the galaxy
We're the lords of Space Dundee
The destroyers of reality
On a quest for all eternity
We're the masters of the galaxy
We’re the lords of Space Dundee
The destroyers of reality
Knights of evil, arise

[Verse 2]
Leading the charge is the mightiest scion of evil
(Mighty indeed)
Proletius his name, grandmaster of death and decay
(Worship or bleed)
In another dimension he fought for the king
And the glory of all Dundee
Now corrupted by darkness, he kills everything
Mwah-hahaha

[Pre-Chorus]
Stabbed through the heart with the Knife of Evil, it infected his brain
Anti-Telharsic power now flowing through his veins

[Chorus]
We are the masters of the galaxy
We're the lords of Space Dundee
The destroyers of reality
On a quest that's never ending
We're the masters of the galaxy
We're the lords of Space Dundee
The destroyers of reality
Knights of evil, arise

[Bridge: Lord Zargothrax & Grand Master Proletius]
Grand Master Proletius! Dispatch your Knights of Evil to slaughter more peasants in Auchtermuchty!
As you command, Lord Zargothrax. Deathknights of Crail, to battle!

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
We are the masters of the galaxy
We're the lords of Space Dundee
The destroyers of reality
On a quest for all eternity
We're the masters of the galaxy
We're the lords of Space Dundee
The destroyers of reality
Knights of evil, arise

[Outro]
Arise, arise, arise



# The Land of Unicorns

[Verse 1]
I have arrived in a world ruled by chaos and evil
Darkness enfolds the land that I once called my home
Lost in the realm of an ancient and powerful wizard
Now I must quest to take back the Crystalline Throne

[Pre-Chorus]
Legends speak of a glen
Where truth and justice still reign

[Chorus]
Ride far away, cross the mighty River Tay
Over mountains into the unknown
Follow your heart, let it guide you through the dark
To the Land of Unicorns

[Verse 2]
Follow the path laid down by the forces of justice
Over the stones and into the mountains of fire
Fighting with trolls and undead defenders of chaos
Onwards I ride in search of the land I desire

[Pre-Chorus]
Descend out of the mists
The valley of Achnasheen

[Chorus]
Ride far away, cross the mighty River Tay
Over mountains into the unknown
Follow your heart, let it guide you through the dark
To the Land of Unicorns

[Bridge]
The mists are clearing now
I see the realm before my eyes
Ralathor the warrior greets me to the mystic land
The Land of Unicorns

[Chorus]
Ride far away, cross the mighty River Tay
Over mountains into the unknown
Follow your heart, let it guide you through the dark
To the Land of Unicorns
Ride far away, cross the mighty River Tay
Over mountains into the unknown
Follow your heart, let it guide you through the dark
To the Land of Unicorns
To the Land of Unicorns



# Power of the Laser Dragon Fire

[Verse 1]
Remember the days long ago when we fought side by side for the glory?
Battling foes of Dundee in a war in the sky
Now in this valley we hide, the last hope in this desperate story
Onwards into the unknown, you must quest forever

[Pre-Chorus]
In an alternate dimension
Under spell of evil warlock
There's no chance to return to our home

[Chorus]
Now we're far away, lost in a different reality
Slaying dragons
Fighting to save the Kingdom of Fife
We are warriors
Wielding the Hammer so glorious
Fighting with the power of the Laser Dragon Fire

[Verse 2]
I have discovered a scroll, telling tales of equipment for wizard
A jetpack of ultimate steel with the power to fly
It lies in a cave to the north guarded by unholy creatures
But if your quest is to fail, we'll all die together

[Pre-Chorus]
With the boost of mighty jetpack
Into outer space you can arise
And find your destiny once more

[Chorus]
Now we're far away, lost in a different reality
Slaying dragons
Fighting to save the Kingdom of Fife
We are warriors
Wielding the Hammer so glorious
Fighting with the power of the Laser Dragon Fire

[Post-Chorus]
Ride forth, mighty warrior, beyond the crystalline gates of the Land of Unicorns, into the great plaguelands of Caithness. There you must seek your true destiny. Many perils await you on your journey, but victorious you will return with the power to defeat Zargothrax for all eternity!

[Bridge]
Remember the heroes
Who died in the war of Space Dundee
Now lost in another galaxy

[Pre-Chorus]
Far away, lost in a different reality
One more final battle to save the Kingdom of Fife

[Chorus]
Far away, lost in a different reality
Slaying dragons
Fighting to save the Kingdom of Fife
We are warriors
Wielding the Hammer so glorious
Fighting with the power of the
Ancient holy tragic raging Laser Dragon Fire



# Legendary Enchanted Jetpack

[Verse 1]
Quest for Fife to end pain and strife
In search of the enchanted engine
Far and wide, I roam through Speyside
Into the deepest dark dungeon
There it waits, behind golden gates
Sealed in a chest made of diamonds
Heart pure as steel I must reveal
To hold artifact in my hands

[Pre-Chorus]
A gleam of steam surrounds the machine of might

[Chorus]
And in my dreams I am flying (Woah-oh)
Over Cowdenbeath
Across an endless horizon (Woah-oh)
Fly forever free
Below me I can see the world so far away
And in my dreams I am flying (Woah-oh)
Flying through the Kingdom of Dundee
On a jetpack made of cosmic steel

[Verse 2]
Run for your life, the cave now is rife
With laser trolls sudden appearing
Wizard must know where I was to go
Though he sent his hordes, I'm not fearing
Battle is fight with beams of black light
Clashing with my mighty hammer
The evil troll shoots, lacking power of hoots
Never they will prevail

[Pre-Chorus]
There is a goblin in the castle, take heed

[Chorus]
And in my dreams I am flying (Woah-oh)
Over Cowdenbeath
Across an endless horizon (Woah-oh)
Fly forever free
Below me I can see the world so far away
And in my dreams I am flying (Woah-oh)
Flying through the Kingdom of Dundee
On a jetpack made of cosmic steel

[Bridge]
Now it's time to fly away, starborn defender
To realms beyond space I will soar
Clouds beneath and stars lie before me
No return forevermore, so
Hail to you, all that I've known here
With speed of light I'm to rise
Heavenwards, wielding the hammer
Riding on the astral fire far beyond the sky

[Chorus]
And in my dreams I am flying (Woah-oh)
Over Cowdenbeath
Across an endless horizon (Woah-oh)
Fly forever free
Below me I can see the world so far away
And in my dreams I am flying (Woah-oh)
Flying through the Kingdom of Dundee
On a jetpack made of cosmic steel




# Gloryhammer

[Intro]
Glory! Hammer!

That I have arrived into space, oh yeah
I feel the astral fire burning
It's blazing deep inside of me

Glory! Hammer!
Since 1992
Glory! Hammer!

[Bridge]
Forged by ancient gods of warfare
Wrought of lasers from the sun
Now suffused with astral fire
It is time for battle
Every knee will bow before me
Every goblin king will fall
Now the time has come
To regain our fallen pride once more

[Pre-Chorus]
Fly high into space to raise my
Heavy Metal Darklord Crasher
With the stars of this universe now
Lying in my hands
My steel will blow you away
Mighty prince with a licence to slay
Fighting mega battles every day
Glory! Hammer!
Glory! Hammer!
Glory! Hammer!

[Chorus]
Glory! Hammer!
Wielding steel that is true
Glory! Hammer!
Since 1992
Glory! Hammer!
For the King of Dundee, my destiny

Yeah, It is my destiny
(Glory! Hammer!)
To rule the galaxy
(Glory! Hammer!)
I am the one
The chosen son
Glory! Hammer!

Fight for the king, for the hammer and the ring
Fight for the ancient story
Fight for your life, we must fight for Fife
For the power and the glory
Hootsforce arise

[Verse 1]
All across the land of Fife, grim chaos reigns supreme
Shackled by the mind control of the dark lord of Dundee
Yet still there lies the chance of hope, now Angus has returned
The sigil of the Hootsforce in the sky tonight will burn

[Chorus]
Fight for the king, for the hammer and the ring

Forces of resistance, it is time to make a stand

Sub Commander Ralathor, engage your nuclear force
The battlefield of Cowdenbeath is where we'll set our course

[Pre-Chorus]
In a submarine
Beneath the seas
Of Achnasheen
We remain unseen
But now the time
Has come to rise
Ascend into the skies
(Hoots force)

Fight for the king, for the hammer and the ring
Fight for the ancient story

# Battle for Eternity

[Intro]
I am the final defender

[Verse 1]
Have you ever seen the galaxy ablaze?
Have you ever fought a wizard face to face?
Have you ever watched the Kingdom turn to dust
As a unicorn devours with its lust?

[Pre-Chorus]
I have seen many worlds
And traveled through time
But nothing prepares
For ultimate fight

[Chorus]
I am the final defender
The last hope for this galaxy
Dundee will arise from evil demise
I'm the one with the power to win
The Battle for Eternity

[Verse 2]
Have you ever killed a goblin on the moon?
Have you ever rode an eagle to its doom?
Have you ever seen the spires of proud Dundee
Burning with the fire of destiny?

[Pre-Chorus]
The Kingdom of Fife
Will never to die
Raise up your hammer
And scream to the sky

[Chorus]
I am the final defender
The last hope for this galaxy
Dundee will arise from evil demise
I'm the one with the power to win
The Battle for Eternity

[Bridge]
I am the final defender

[Chorus]
I am the final defender
The last hope for this galaxy
Dundee will arise from evil demise
I'm the one with the power to win, yeah
I am the final defender
The last hope for this galaxy
Dundee will arise from evil demise
I'm the one with the power to win
The Battle for Eternity



# The Fires of Ancient Cosmic Destiny

[Chorus]
In the fires of ancient cosmic destiny
Evil will rise
And of all the legendary warriors
None will survive
In the fires of ancient cosmic destiny
Evil will rise
To defeat the power of the sorcerer
Great sacrifice

[Verse 1]
Magnificent vessel appears in the sky
The Hootsforce arrives into Cowdenbeath
Prepare for the warfare of ultimate destiny
Into the battle, the heroes make fight
Fast as Dundonian lightning they strike
The armies of evil will die on the field
They'll die by our steel

[Spoken Interlude - Zargothrax]
And the battlefield of Cowdenbeath fell silent, as the black gates of the fortress of Crail opened wide. Atop a horde of undead eagles, the grim armies of the Deathknights of Crail rode out to meet the forces of justice. And at the vanguard of this terrible host stood the Grandmaster himself, Dreadlord Proletius!

[Verse 2]
From the black gate evil deathknights attack
Proletius is leading the chaos charge
Slaughtering peasants with deadly impunity
Ralathor fires his final defence
Missiles of nuclear justice
The deathknights are suddenly vaporized
Proletius dies

[Chorus]
For the King of Space
We will fight to end disgrace
In our once proud land
We will make our stand
When the dark lord comes
We will shoot our laser guns
For the glory of mighty Dundee

[Spoken Interlude - Zargothrax]
Mwah-hahaha! Such a pathetic display of valor! You are naught but insignificant worms before the infinite power of Zargothrax! Now, the solar conjunction is at hand. My ascension to godhood is inevitable and there is nothing you can do to stop me! Worship my omnipotence!

[Refrain]
From the Heavens
Comes a hero
Mighty Hootsman
Vanitati
Latinae
Canentis
Hootus Dei

[Bridge]
With a flash of thunder
A god falls from the sky
With holy armor made from wolf
The Hootsman has arrived
Side by side with Angus
The warriors make fight
Hootsman fires a laser blast
Shoots goblins out of sight

[Refrain]
From the Heavens
Comes a hero
Mighty Hootsman
Vanitati
Latinae
Canentis
Hootus Dei

[Chorus]
In the fires of ancient cosmic destiny
Evil will rise
And of all the legendary warriors
None will survive
In the fires of ancient cosmic destiny
Evil will rise
To defeat the power of the sorcerer
The Hootsman has arrived

[Spoken Interlude - Hootsman]
Alright Zargothrax, your evil reign of terror ends today! My name is the Hootsman, and I am the one and only true god of this universe! It is time for you to taste the power of Hoots!

[Verse 3]
With the force of the hammer
And the power of Hoots
The forces of justice attack
Bringing destruction to Zargothrax
The wizard defeated
Dissolves into dust
The Kingdom of Fife has been saved
The legendary Angus McFife has triumphed this day

[Spoken Interlude - Zargothrax]
And lo, Zargothrax was finally defeated. But in the epic final struggle with the dark sorcerer, the valiant hero Angus McFife realised he had been impaled by the Knife of Evil. As he watched the lifeless corpse of Zargothrax dissolve into liquid dust, Angus knew that soon he himself would be corrupted by the dark power of that cursed blade. And so he resolved that he must make the final sacrifice for the Glory of Dundee. He would end his own life by descending into the raging volcanic fires of Schiehallion!

[Verse 4]
Goodbye
My time has come to die
This is the end
I must say farewell
Descend into hell

[Chorus]
In the fires of ancient cosmic destiny
Evil will rise
And of all the legendary warriors
None will survive
In the fires of ancient cosmic destiny
Evil will rise
To defeat the power of the sorcerer
The Prince of Fife must die
In the fires of ancient cosmic destiny
Evil will rise
And of all the legendary warriors
None will survive
In the fires of ancient cosmic destiny
Evil will rise
To defeat the power of the sorcerer
The Prince of Fife must die
To save the galaxy
It is your mighty destiny
Brave Angus McFife
