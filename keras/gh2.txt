# Infernus Ad Astra

In the distant future of the year 1992, war has returned to the galaxy


# Rise of the Chaos Wizards

[Refrain]
Sanctus dominus
Infernus ad astra
Sanctus dominus
Infernus ad astra
Sanctus dominus
Infernus ad astra
Sanctus dominus
Infernus ad astra

[Verse 1]
Across the galaxy a new force of evil is rising
Wizards of Chaos fight to dethrone the brave king of Dundee
Entwined by mystic spells, they know where the sorcerer hidden
Imprisoned in ice on the planet of Knights, the powerful heroes of Crail

Aeons of warfare returning
No longer peace will survive
The intergalactic great Empire of Fife will die

[Chorus]
For the king we will ride
Through the dark galactic skies
To defeat the foes
When the Chaos Wizards rise
Now the universe will burn
Evil sorcerer returns
Tragic fate rages tonight
Chaos Wizard rise

Sanctus dominus
Infernus ad astra
Sanctus dominus
Infernus ad astra

[Verse 2]
Ten centuries ago brave heroes defeated the wizard
Now Chaos reigns and evil returns to the kingdom of Fife
Wizard cultists rage - on dark wings of steel they are flying
To space they must go, great terror they sow, nothing can stand in their way

The Space Knights of Crail are defeated
The fortress of Triton is lost
Zargothrax rises once more from his prison of frost

[Chorus]
For the king we will ride
Through the dark galactic skies
To defeat the foes
When the Chaos Wizards rise
Now the universe will burn
Evil sorcerer returns
Tragic fate rages tonight
Chaos Wizard rise!

[Spoken Interlude - Zargothrax]
And lo, after centuries of frozen slumber I am free once more
Cosmic infinity courses through my veins
My body is ablaze with astral terror
The galaxy shall once again tremble before the might of Zargothrax

[Refrain]
Sanctus dominus
Infernus ad astra
Sanctus dominus
Infernus ad astra

[Chorus]
For the king we will ride
Through the dark galactic skies
To defeat the foes
When the Chaos Wizards rise
Now the universe will burn
Evil sorcerer returns
Tragic fate rages tonight
Chaos Wizard rise!
Rise!



# Legend of the Astral Hammer

[Verse 1]
Legend of the Astral Hammer

Slashing my way through an army of goblins
On the dark side of the moon
Far overhead lunar dragons are swarming
My hammer will be their doom

Angus McFife the 13th my name
Scion of mighty Dundee
Intergalactic great hero of steel
Ruler the whole galaxy

Wielding this ancestral weapon
The Hammer of Glory its name
The Kingdom of Fife will forever proclaim

[Chorus]
Legend of the Astral Hammer
Forged in the heart of celestial fire
Legend of the Astral Hammer
Minuscule goblin, impractical sword
Legend of the Astral Hammer
Powered by lasers entwined in a star
Legend of the Astral Hammer
Crystal enchantment of steel

[Verse 2]
Eons ago, the starlords descended
Powerful unknown to man
With three epic weapons to safeguard from doom
Concealing them far cross the land

Relics of legend, relics of might
Forged in a time before time
For thousands of years, unfathomed, unknown
Deep in a mystical shrine

Descendant of ultimate fighter
Now battle a war in the stars
Defending the kingdom from demons of Mars

[Chorus]
Legend of the Astral Hammer
Forged in the heart of celestial fire
Legend of the Astral Hammer
Minuscule goblin, impractical sword
Legend of the Astral Hammer
Powered by lasers entwined in a star
Legend of the Astral Hammer
Crystal enchantment of steel

[Verse 3]
Now Zargothrax rises once more
To threaten the force of the light
Assemble the heroes of steel
Prepare for the ultimate fight

Legend of the Astral Hammer
Legend of the Astral Hammer

[Chorus]
Legend of the Astral Hammer
Forged in the heart of celestial fire
Legend of the Astral Hammer
Minuscule goblin, impractical sword
Legend of the Astral Hammer
Powered by lasers entwined in a star

Crystal enchantment of steel



# Goblin King of the Darkstorm Galaxy

[Chorus]
Goblin King of the Darkstorm Galaxy
Ride on the wings of doom
Grant me the power to fight my foes
And defeat the lords of the Moon

I have returned from centuries of slumber
Now the universe must burn
I feel the power yet still I thirst for more
Ancient secrets I must learn

I ride the twilight in search of cosmic fire
The Goblin King knows my desire

[Pre-Chorus]
Regis
Kobalos
Cast unholy fire

[Chorus (x2)]

This magic crystal is the artifact you seek
To unleash evil from the sky
You must find the portal, the crystal is the key
All universal life will die

Deep beneath Dundee, the mighty citadel
There lies a passage way to Hell

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus (x2)]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus (x2)]



# The Hollywood Hootsman

One thousand years ago a hero crossed the sea
In search of distant realms to claim his destiny
The land of Unst was not enough he had to conquer more
Into the west a hero quests, to far American shores!
With his mighty battle axe he slaughtered everything
Till all of California did call the hero king!

He's The Hollywood Hootsman!
HAIL TO HOOTS!
Mighty proud and standing tall
A legend to us all!

He's The Hollywood Hootsman!

Immortal warrior with armor made from wolf
His legend proves the centuries with the power of the hoots!
His prowess on the battlefield does show on the stage
In Hollywood he found his fame, the finest of his age!
The greatest movie star to ever walk the land
If you ever meet this man I'm sure you'll understand!

He's The Hollywood Hootsman!
HAIL TO HOOTS!
Mighty proud and standing tall
A legend to us all!

# Victorious Eagle Warfare

[Verse 1]
There was a time, when legends of Crail rang true
All over their majesty everyone knew
But now in the future, defeated by evil untold
We yearn for the Knight from stories of old
My hero cannot be defeated simply by making him die
Proletius will rise a hologram hero of light

[Chorus]
Victorious eagle warfare
So glorious riding high up in the sky
Victorious eagle warfare
Brave warriors questing hard until they die
With nothing above but the heavens above
Guiding us on through the war
Eagle Force

[Verse 2]
Inside the chamber of cryogenetical fire
A magical wizard is doing a spell
Powered by robots a hologram coming to life
To stand at the side of the King of Fife
The galaxy knights are rising, reborn from the ashes of Crail
A force for the light to whom we eternally hail

[Chorus]
Victorious eagle warfare
So glorious riding high up in the sky
Victorious eagle warfare
Brave warriors questing hard until they die
With nothing above but the heavens above
Guiding us on through the war
Eagle Force

[Spoken]
Mighty warriors of the Galaxy, you have proven yourselves to be mighty indeed
Now, who of you will join me in my Space Knights of Crail?

[Chorus]
Victorious eagle warfare
So glorious riding high up in the sky
Victorious eagle warfare
Brave warriors questing hard until they die
With nothing above but the heavens above
Fight against power of evil corrupt
Guiding us on through the war
Eagle Force



# Questlords of Inverness, Ride to the Galactic Fortress!

The Questlords of Inverness ride
Far far away, to the ultimate light
Travelling throughout the time
The Questlords of Inverness ride
To Galactic Fortress!

They storm the universe in interstellar time
From the town of Inverness beneath the ancient sign
Warriors of power steel who hear galactic cry
Unicorn defenders, unafraid to die

Zargothrax is riding on, with crystal key in hand
Nobody can stop him, bring death across the land
Questlords of Inverness, the time has come to fight
Ride to space battle with brave highland's might

Questlords arise, fight til we die
For the honour, the glory, the pride
Ride on the wind and hail to the king
When the Questlords of Inverness ride

Mighty heroes quest to Mars to fight the demon horde
Undead force of terror, will fall beneath the sword
Raise the flag of Inverness, rally all the troops
Fight for Dundee and the power of Hoots

Unicorn! Show me the way
Lead me to the ultimate fortress
Unicorn! Reveal the truth
Of the ancient crystal galaxy



# Universe on Fire

I wanna set the universe on fire
Feel it burn tonight
Set the universe on fire
There's no end in sight

Bring me to the holy raging power
Where I find my destiny
The universe on fire
You're my guiding light

Carrying the breath of fire
Within the lungs of steel
Soaring to light the flame
Forged by Cosmic Ordeal

Ascending on the mighty dragon with metal wings and claw
In a great battle foregoing one thousand years ago
Now lead me to the stars
Atomic flame ignite my heart

I wanna set the universe on fire
Feel it burn tonight
Set the universe on fire
There's no end in sight

Bring me to the holy raging power
Where I find my destiny
The universe on fire
You're my guiding light

Gliding across the sun
To soak up all its might
Charging my solar gun
And prepare for epic fight

Questing through nebulas in search for crystal stone
That gives me the overdose of force to claim the space throne
It is time take up your arms
Nova bombs and plasma guns

I wanna set the universe on fire
Feel it burn tonight
Set the universe on fire
There's no end in sight

Bring me to the... Holy raging power
Where I find my destiny
The universe on fire
You're my guiding light

Set me on fire
I wanna set the universe on fire
Feel it burn tonight
Set the universe on fire
There's no end in sight

Bring me to the holy raging power
Where I find my destiny
The universe on fire
You're my guiding light

You're my guiding light
You're my guiding light



# Heroes (of Dundee)

As word spread of the demon army invasion that was threatening Mars, mighty warriors of the entire galaxy began to assemble in preparation to fight for the power of the cosmic justice. Crystalline darkness was falling upon the hearts of the assembled host. After a thousand years of peace, the Intergalactic Space Empire of Fife was about to once again plunge into a bloody war, standing behind the banner of Angus McFife XIII. Riding his ancestral laserdragon, the brave prince of Dundee stood before his proud legions and raised the Hammer of Glory to the heavens

Fly! On gigantic dragons made out of steel
Strike! With the Hammer of Glory, we will prevail
Kill! Our cosmical enemies with full force, blasting forth without remorse

Rage! With bold supersonic velocity
Trust! In our lasers to storm 'cross the galaxy
Die! For the universe that we are fighting for, to win the war, forevermore

For Dunkeld and Cowdenbeath, an epic war is fight

We are heroes, heroes of Dundee
We are riding forth to free our galaxy
We are heroes, heroes of Dundee
We are heroes, legends we will be!

Fear! Our troll mass destruction artillery
Hear! Our battlecry echoing through the sphere
Ride! On the back of the dragons, we’re standing proud, wrath unbound, we hold our ground

For Crail and for Aberdeen, an epic war is fight

We passed primordial black holes
Fought goblins and trolls on faraway stars
Together we dashed through infinity for honour and glory
From Neptune to Mars to Mercury
To bring it all to an end, to make our final stand
In unity we rise, we will ascend to realms we must protect
Mighty hammer connects
The force to annihilate Zargothrax

Yes, mighty warriors! In the name of cosmic justice we ride
Glory will prevail this day...hail to the King of Dundee!

We are heroes, heroes of Dundee
Now the time has come that we'll make history
We are heroes, heroes of Dundee
We are heroes, legends we will be!



# Apocalypse 1992

[Spoken: Narrator]
And lo, led by the valiant hero Angus McFife XIII
The forces of justice assembled their armies in the skies above Mars
In preparation for the epic battle against the demon horde
But on planet Earth, a far more sinister machination was afoot
In the dwarven caverns beneath the mighty citadel of Dundee
The evil wizard Zargothrax began to recite the dread incantation
Which would unlock the Chaos Portal to the galactic nexus
As foretold in the dark prophecy of Anstruther countless centuries ago
As he placed the goblin king's crystal key into the altar before him
Ancient runes began to glow on the surface of the portal
Soon the gateway would open and the elder god Korviliath
Of the eighteenth hell dimension would be unleashed onto the galaxy
The countdown to universal annihilation had begun

[Voice-Modulated Star Nucleus]
Warriors of planet Earth, hear my raging cry
For mighty Dundee, the demons will die

[Spoken]
Yes, battle cruisers
To space we'll go
Discover new worlds
And conquer galaxies

[Voice-Modulated Star Nucleus]
Across the skies of Mars, the demon wars begin
Trust in your sword, this battle we'll win
The space knights of Crail are first to the fight
Clashing with lasers and power of might

Fly high through apocalypse skies
Fight for the world we must save
Like tears of a unicorn lost in the rain
Chaos will triumph this day
Apocalypse 1992

At the speed of light the dwarven king arrives
With crystal laser battleaxe into the fight he rides

[Spoken: Korviliath]
Pathetic dwarves
You are no match for my demon hordes
Let battle commence

[Voice-Modulated Star Nucleus]
It's the rage, the cosmic rage
The cosmic rage of astral dwarves from Aberdeen
From their mines they will arise and fight
The rage of the dwarves is tonight

It's the rage, the cosmic rage
The cosmic rage of astral dwarves from Aberdeen
From their mines they will arise and fight
The rage of the dwarves is tonight

De mortuis crepitus
Aberdonensis de furor
Infernus irae!
Then they died

My ancestral demon army
Will ride a cosmic sphere
And liberate the multiverse
From slavery and fear
With the power of the crystal
From an ancient galaxy
The force of evil will prevail
It is my destiny

Fly high through apocalypse skies
Fight for the world we must save
Like tears of a unicorn lost in the rain
Chaos will triumph this day

Fly high through apocalypse skies
Fight for the world we must save
Like tears of a unicorn lost in the rain
Chaos will triumph this day
Apocalypse 1992

From the caves beneath Dundee
Ancient hermit arrives
A messenger to the war in the stars
Korviliath is nigh

Deep inside the Hootsman there lies a secret heart
Barbarian is a cyborg powered by a neutron star
For centuries immortal he will quest in time and space
But now he must make sacrifice to save the human race

The only way to save the galaxy
Is to destroy planet Earth and Aberdeen

Faster than a laser bullet
Hootsman flies to Fife
He detonates his neutron
Destroys all human life

Fly high through apocalypse skies
Fight for the world we must save
Like tears of a unicorn lost in the rain
Chaos will triumph this day

Fly high through apocalypse skies
Fight for the world we must save
Like tears of a unicorn lost in the rain
Chaos will triumph this day
Apocalypse

[Spoken: Narrator]
With a thunderous implosion the Earth was vaporised
Tearing a dimensional rift in the heavens
Using his last shards of power
Zargothrax plunged through the space portal
Vanishing into another reality
And so Angus McFife XIII followed him into the wormhole
For the eternal glory of Dundee

[Sung]
Sanctus!
Dominus!
